                <h2>In Late 1960s</h2>
                <p>
                    In the year 1960s, I was alone in the streets and had nowhere to go, so a lady came to me and said,
                    <q>I
                        found you</q>. I was kind of confused at first then I saw her horns and got frighten. She said
                    <q>don't get
                        frightened like that, I won't eat you. I am a singer and a shapeshifting Dragon</q>. Her name is
                    "Baimeimo"
                    so I stayed with her for some time. Until she got attacked by Royal court. She was arrested for
                    trespassing and shapeshifts.

            <h2>In 1980s</h2>
            <p>
                ​So I was also at the Royal Court and they made me also a hostage. I don't know why and what's the
                reason. Until one day, they released me from the chains and sent me to the Royal court. Their I saw the
                same lady. Arguing about something, And got to know that she was from the demon army. But the argument
                was about if she is still loyal or not. As 90 years ago the battle between Humans and demons was tie and
                signed a peace treaty. So the main question was why is she here.
            </p>
            <p>
                ​Well in the mean time the King's daughter got interest in me. She is a naughty one but she is also very
                sweet. But when I told her about my curse she wasn't surprised at all. Instead she said I will remove
                your curse in return you will have to stay with me. What a Major turn of events.
            </p>
            <p>
                ​In the meantime. The Demon Lady's case got resolved and she got the right to live in Royal capital.
                Because she looks more human than a Demon. Because of that she was outcasted by the Demon Emperor. But
                there's a catch she has to sing in the royal court and can't sing anywhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, what starts well ends well.
